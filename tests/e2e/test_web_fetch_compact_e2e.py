"""E2E probe: WebFetch secondary-model post-processing via compact role.

Drives the live kernel through the LLM so WebFetch's deferred tool
gets promoted via ToolSearch, then called with a ``prompt`` parameter
that triggers the secondary-model path.  The summary should come from
the configured ``compact`` role (Bedrock Haiku in the dev config);
we verify end-to-end behaviour — the LLM receives a meaningfully
compressed result and can answer the user based on the summary.
