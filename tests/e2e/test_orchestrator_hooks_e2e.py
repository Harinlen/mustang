"""E2E tests for Orchestrator STEP 3 features: POST_SAMPLING hook and abort check.

Coverage map
------------
test_post_sampling_fires_during_normal_turn
    → POST_SAMPLING hook fires without crashing the Orchestrator pipeline.
      Verified indirectly: a normal prompt completes with stop_reason=end_turn,
      meaning the new hook fire-point in STEP 3c did not break the turn flow.

test_cancel_mid_turn_produces_valid_history
    → Abort check (STEP 3d): cancel a running turn, reload the session,
      and verify the history does not contain orphan tool_use blocks
      (every tool_use has a matching tool_result).

test_session_usable_after_cancel
    → After cancellation with synthetic tool_results patched into history,
      the session can accept a new prompt without errors.
