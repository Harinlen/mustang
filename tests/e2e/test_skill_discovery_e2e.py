"""E2E: Skill discovery — multi-layer, compat, disabled, eligibility.

These tests verify that the kernel discovers SKILL.md files from
.mustang/skills/ and .claude/skills/ directories, applies priority
rules, and filters ineligible skills.

The kernel subprocess is started by the ``kernel`` session fixture.
Skills are created in temporary directories and the session is started
with ``cwd`` pointing at those directories.
