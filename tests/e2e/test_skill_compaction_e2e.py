"""E2E: Compaction preservation for invoked skills.

Tests that the compactor's create_skill_attachment() function works
correctly.  Since triggering compaction in E2E requires filling the
context window (expensive), we test the compaction preservation
mechanism at the unit-integration level — verifying the function
produces correct output when called with real SkillManager state.
