"""In-memory registry of every live kernel module.

The table is the kernel's equivalent of Linux's module list: one
authoritative place that records *what is currently loaded into the
kernel*.  It is built once at startup by the FastAPI lifespan and
exposed on ``app.state.module_table`` so routes and handlers can look
things up from a single entry point.

The two bootstrap services (``FlagManager`` / ``ConfigManager``) and
the regular ``Subsystem`` subclasses live side-by-side in the table
but are stored differently on purpose:

- **Bootstrap services** occupy dedicated typed attributes
  (``flags`` / ``config``).  They are instantiated before any regular
  Subsystem, every Subsystem depends on them, and they have richer
  public APIs than the uniform startup/shutdown contract — giving
  them their own fields makes that asymmetry visible in the type
  system and keeps lookup cheap and typed.

- **Regular Subsystems** go into ``_subsystems``, a dict keyed by
  the Subsystem class itself so :meth:`get` can return a strongly-
  typed instance without string lookups or ``cast`` at call sites.
  Insertion order is preserved so the lifespan can unload in reverse
  without keeping a parallel list.

The table does not manage lifecycles — it only remembers what was
loaded.  The lifespan is responsible for constructing, starting,
registering, and (on shutdown) unloading entries.
