"""Why the agent stopped the current turn.

``end_turn``
    The LLM finished normally without requesting more tools.
``max_tokens``
    Token limit reached.
``max_turn_requests``
    Maximum number of LLM round-trips in a single turn exceeded.
``refusal``
    The agent refused to continue.
``cancelled``
    ``session/cancel`` was received.  MUST be returned as a success
    response, NOT as a JSON-RPC error — clients distinguish this from
    actual failures by checking ``stopReason``.
