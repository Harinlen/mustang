"""ConfigManager section schema for the Skills subsystem.

Sits in ``skills.yaml`` under section ``skills``.  The runtime
mutation surface is currently empty — every field below is pure
metadata read at startup.

Today's knobs:

``claude_compat``
    Opt-in switch for scanning ``.claude/skills/`` directories
    alongside the native ``.mustang/skills/`` roots.  **Default:
    False.**  Rationale: ``.claude/skills/`` is a Claude-Code-CLI
    convention that developers working on this repo can populate
    with session-scoped workflow skills (e.g. ``/done-check``).
    Those dev-workflow skills are not meaningful to Mustang's LLM
    when a real user is running the kernel, so the default behaviour
    is to ignore them.  Users who genuinely want to reuse their
    Claude Code user-level skills inside Mustang can set this to
    True — see ``docs/kernel/subsystems/skills.md`` §Claude Code
    skill 兼容.
