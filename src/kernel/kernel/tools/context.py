"""ToolContext — the single channel through which a Tool touches the kernel.

Design rules (see [`docs/plans/landed/tool-manager.md`](../../../docs/plans/landed/tool-manager.md) § 5):

1. Tool must **only** access kernel state via ``ToolContext``.  No module
   imports of SessionManager / HookManager / ToolAuthorizer from inside
   ``Tool.call``.
2. Mutations to session-level state (cwd, env, worktree path, …) go
   through ``ToolCallResult.context_modifier`` — a pure function applied
   by the Orchestrator — **not** by directly mutating the context passed
   in.
3. No ``authorizer_hint`` field (aligned with Claude Code — Tools don't
   pre-check permissions; all authorization happens at the ToolExecutor
   layer via ToolAuthorizer).
