"""Automatic SQLite schema migrations for the session store.

Uses ``PRAGMA user_version`` — a free integer stored in the SQLite DB header —
to track which migrations have been applied.  No extra tables are needed.

How it works
------------
``SCHEMA_VERSION`` is the highest version this build understands.

On every ``SessionStore.open()``:

1. ``Base.metadata.create_all`` creates all tables on a fresh install
   (no-op if they already exist).
2. ``apply()`` reads ``PRAGMA user_version``.
3. **Version 0 (fresh DB)**: ``create_all`` already did the right thing;
   stamp it with ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` and return.
4. **Version < SCHEMA_VERSION (upgrade)**: run each pending migration in
   order.  Each migration + its version bump run inside the same
   ``BEGIN … COMMIT`` block — if a migration fails the version is not
   advanced and the next startup will retry it.
5. **Version == SCHEMA_VERSION**: nothing to do.

Adding a migration
------------------
1. Write a ``async def _migrate_to_N(conn: AsyncConnection) -> None`` function.
2. Append ``(N, "short description", _migrate_to_N)`` to ``_MIGRATIONS``.
3. Bump ``SCHEMA_VERSION = N``.

The list MUST remain in ascending version order.  Never delete or reorder
entries — the version numbers are permanent.
